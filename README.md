# Github Website Themer

**Github Website Themer** is a userscript that simply changes the main color in the website called [Github](https://github.com/) that you are currently reading **[this](https://github.com/xNasuni/GithubWebsiteThemer)** on.

> This utilizes a **keyword** in **CSS** to **override** the current CSS rules and put **priority** over all the other CSS style sheets, known as "**!important**" and some other **tweaks**.

## Extra Information

> **Github Website Themer** might become a project to style even more websites, which I would like to call "**`ChromaSwitcher`**" or something like that in the future.
> 
> `If you encounter problems using this script, such as parts of the website that don't change color, please report it as an issue in`[**`here`**](https://github.com/xNasuni/GithubWebsiteThemer/issues)`.`
